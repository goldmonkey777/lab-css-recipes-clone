# Learning Report - Lab CSS Recipes Clone

My name is Elder Miranda. I am a student at Ironhack and also the founder of GoldMonkey Studio. I am always eager to learn and improve my skills, and this lab was a great opportunity for me to grow as a developer.

## Introduction

When I started this lab, I knew almost nothing about HTML and CSS. I had never structured a web page from scratch, nor did I know how selectors, classes, ids, or external stylesheets worked. Everything was new to me.

## What I Learned

### 1. Basic HTML Structure
I learned how to create the basic structure of an HTML file, including the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags, and how to organize content semantically using `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<section>`, and others.

### 2. Inserting Images
I discovered how to insert images into the page using the `<img>` tag and how to set the correct path for images inside the project folders.

### 3. Organizing Content
I understood the importance of separating content into sections, like ingredients, directions, and extra information, using semantic tags and classes to make styling easier.

### 4. External CSS
I learned how to create and link an external CSS file to style the whole page, instead of using inline or internal styles.

### 5. Selectors, Classes, and IDs
I understood the difference between type, class, and id selectors, and how to use them to style specific elements or groups of elements.

### 6. Style Properties
I discovered how to use properties like `background-image`, `background-size`, `margin`, `padding`, `border-radius`, `box-shadow`, `text-align`, and others to make the page look nicer and more like the provided example.

### 7. Centering and Responsiveness
I learned techniques to center elements on the screen and make sure the page looks good on different screen sizes, using `max-width`, `margin: auto`, and `display: flex`.

### 8. Best Practices
I understood the importance of keeping code organized, commented, and following best practices like separating structure (HTML) from style (CSS).

## Conclusion

Before this exercise, I knew nothing about HTML and CSS. Now, I can create a recipe page from scratch, structuring the content semantically and applying styles to make it beautiful and functional. I am very grateful for the opportunity to learn with this lab and with the guidance from my instructors and classmates.
